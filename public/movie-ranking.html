<h1>Lindsey's Movie Love List</h1>
<h2>The Best Movies I can think of in 5 minutes</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Princess Mononoke</h3>
<p>The writing, directing, and artwork are phenomenal. The message was compelling and every character had nuance, even the villains.</p>
<h3>The Terminator</h3>
<p>Classic. The directing, script and acting are all iconic. Who can forget The Terminator?</p>
<h3>Everything Everywhere All At Once</h3>
<p>I loved the message, and that it was an Asian-led film at its heart about a family of immigrants as they travel through time and parallel dimensions. Wicked fun.</p>
